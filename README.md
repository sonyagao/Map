The Map program that Amy and Sonya have created is a mixture of the high-end technology of Google Maps and the pre-technology phase of physical paper maps. It creates a map, starting at South Hadley (or Mount Holyoke College) and routes a few possible paths to Boston. Since students are busy with finals and cannot always leave the house without at least having an estimate of how long it would take for them to get from one location to the other, we have created a map application that tracks road conditions for the possible route segments from South Hadley to Boston. For example, if the student wants to take the route from South Hadley to Amherst to Framingham to Boston and wants to know about the road conditions on each segment, the program would take this route input from the student and respond with information on total travel time, number of road delays (i.e. potholes, traffic, droppings, if applicable). If the student is less familiar with the road, then the program will also look at current road conditions and provide a recommendation for the segments for the student to take depending on time. Students, as users, can also insert and remove road conditions as they use the program because their own travel experience will help to enhance the reality of the road situation; thus, if students discover that there are more or less of any type of road delay on the road segments, they can input the new data into the program so that the map is always up to date on the total time it takes to get from one destination to another.
